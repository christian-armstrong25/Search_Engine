{{Unreferenced|date=May 2010}}'''Macro-historical''' analysis seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European [[feudalism]] in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often &quot;assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways&quot;.[http://parallelism.org/13949-WELL-layout2.pdf]

==History==
Examples of macro-historical analysis include [[Karl Marx]]'s assertion that all history can be explained through [[economics]] and [[class struggle]], and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations. [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] which is considered by many historians to be of great macro-historical importance, as it marked the highwater point of Mongol conquests, and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated.

Another example is the [[Battle of Bannockburn]], (June 23?24, 1314), decisive battle in Scottish history, whereby the Scots under Robert the Bruce defeated the English under Edward II, regained their independence, and established Bruce on his throne as Robert I. The Scottish victory was complete and, although full English recognition of Scottish independence was not achieved until more than ten years later, Robert Bruce's position as king was greatly strengthened by the outcome.

Anatopism

An '''anatopism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''???'', &quot;against,&quot; and ''?????'', &quot;place&quot;) is something that is out of its proper place.  Thus, for example, an [[outrigger canoe]] would be an anatopism in [[ancient Rome]].The [[concept]] of anatopism is less widely familiar than that of [[anachronism]], perhaps because much that is anatopistic is also anachronistic.  Yet the distinction is a valid one; not all that is anatopistic is necessarily also anachronistic.

==Examples==
[[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s 2006 film, ''[[The Nativity Story]]'', shows a field of [[maize]] corn in a [[Nazareth]] farming scene.  Maize is native to [[Mesoamerica]], not to the [[Middle East]], and in [[pre-Columbian]] times was grown only in the [[Americas]].  The use of maize in this film is clearly an anatopism.

The [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Boles?aw Prus]], for the sake of making a point, introduces into chapter 63 of his [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in the [[ancient Egypt]] of 1087?1085 BCE, a substance that behaves like [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 579-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  This appears to be both an anachronism and an anatopism, since gunpowder is thought to have been invented, some time later, in [[China]] or in [[Arab world|Arabia]].  Another apparent anatopism introduced by the author (in chapter 45) is an object that resembles a [[telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; that may also be an [[anachronism]].

Historicity (philosophy)

'''Historicity''' in [[philosophy]] is the underlying concept of [[history]], or the intersection of [[teleology]] (the concept and study of progress and purpose), [[temporality]] (the concept of time), and [[historiography]] ([[semiotics]] and history of [[history]]). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.== Concepts of historicity ==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], historicity is the history of constitution of any [[intentionality|intentional]] object, both in the sense of history as [[tradition]] and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition.

[[Martin Heidegger]] argued in ''[[Being and Time]]'' that it is temporality that gives rise to history.  All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history.

[[Francis Fukuyama]] in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' famously argued that the collapse of [[Soviet communism]] brought humanity to the &quot;end of history&quot; whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism.

Before Fukuyama, [[Jean Baudrillard]] argued for a different concept of the &quot;end of history&quot;. Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books ''Fatal Strategies'' and ''The Illusion of the End''. It is for these writings that he received a full-chapter denunciation from the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] (along with [[Jean Bricmont]]), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the &quot;end of history&quot;, in terms of a [[teleology|teleological]] goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilization and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the &quot;speed&quot; at which society moved, effectively 'destabilising' the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it:

:''The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history,'' this is because History itself has become a dustbin. ''It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Illusion of the End'', or ''Selected Writings'', p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] philosophy of [[Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard]]: the idea that society ? and Western society in particular ? has 'dropped out' of the grand narratives of history (for example the coming of Communism or the triumph of civilized modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this 'dropping out' may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a [[universal humanity]]) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to 'play out' this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way ? acting out the end of the end of the end, ''ad infinitum''. Thus Baudrillard argues that ? in a manner similar to [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''Means without Ends'' ? Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist.

[[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of Historicity. Trouillot explains that &quot;The ways in which what happened,and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical&quot;.
